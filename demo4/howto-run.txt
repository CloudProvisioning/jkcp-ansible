On control machine (Ubuntu is recommended for control machine and nodes, tested on 18.04):
// go to tasks directory
// set in hosts file master nodes and slave nodes ip adresses or host names
// set inside keys-forward.yml playbook remote user name (recommended to have same for each target host)
// run playbooks with command:
    ansible-playbook <playbook-name>.yml
// in next order
	install-python.yml // install python on hosts, required for Ansible
    keys-forward.yml // forward ssh keys for access to nodes
    docker-kubernetes-install.yml // install Docker and Kubernetes on hosts
